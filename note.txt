Redux requires a lot of setup
yarn add redux redux-logger react-redux

Higher order component example -  refer https://github.com/ZhangMYihua/higher-order-components-explained

IMPORTANT:

instead of an object, the middleware will call the function with the dispatch
method itself as the first argument
